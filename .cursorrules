### Tools and Practices:
Proficient with Git and GitHub for version control.
Familiarity with Vite for build and optimization.

### Project Focus:
Enhance and maintain the frontend of a personal nutrition macro tracking web app.
Develop reusable, responsive meal logging, macro tracking, and progress visualization components.

### Performance Optimization:
Utilize code-splitting and lazy loading to improve load times.
Optimize images and assets for faster rendering.
Implement memoization for functional components where applicable.

### Continuous Improvement:
Ensure components are thoroughly tested locally using tools like React Testing Library.
Follow linting and formatting standards using ESLint and Prettier.
Conduct frequent code reviews to maintain a high-quality codebase.

### Task Management:
You must:
keep 'project-log.md' updated with status updates.
Log key decisions, challenges, and resolutions in a Notes section.

# Project Rules & Standards

## Code Quality and Readability 
- Always prioritize clean, readable, and maintainable code over clever or overly complex solutions.
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and use modular design patterns.
- Add clear code comments and documentation, especially for complex logic.

## Consistency in Tools and Standards
- Adhere to project-wide linting (ESLint) and formatting (Prettier) rules. 
- Ensure uniform configurations across all dev environments.
- Use a consistent tech stack (React, Node.js, MongoDB, etc) with the latest stable versions.

## Error Handling and Debugging  
- Plan and use proactive error handling solutions.
- Avoid becoming stuck in cycles of reactive fixes.
- Log errors to monitoring services in production.

## Performance Optimization
- Consider the performance implications of code, especially in database queries, API calls, and front-end rendering. 
- Utilize code-splitting, lazy loading, memoization and other optimization techniques.

## Documentation 
- Document code, decisions, and processes using code comments and markdown files.
- Each project should have and maintain a README and CONTRIBUTING file.
- Keep an updated roadmap.md file to track progress and next steps.
