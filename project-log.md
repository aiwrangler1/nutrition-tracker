# Nutrition Tracker Development Plan

## Project Overview

We're building a web application that allows users to:
1. Log daily meals under Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, or Snacks categories.
2. Track macros (protein, carbs, fat) and calculate total calories from them automatically.
3. Visualize daily consumption against user-defined goals (via a dashboard).
4. Access a settings page to configure personal calorie and macro targets.

## Tech Stack

- Next.js (React-based framework for server rendering + routing)
- Ant Design for pre-styled, responsive UI components
- Node.js runtime (included by default in Next.js)
- Supabase for database storage and user authentication
- Simple hosting via GitHub and Render.com

## Data Model

### Users
- id (UUID, PK)
- email (string)
- password_hash (handled by Supabase's built-in auth)
- created_at (timestamp)

### UserGoals
- id (UUID, PK)
- user_id (FK references Users.id)
- daily_calorie_goal (int)
- daily_protein_goal (int)
- daily_carb_goal (int)
- daily_fat_goal (int)
- updated_at (timestamp)

### Meals
- id (UUID, PK)
- user_id (FK references Users.id)
- date (date)
- meal_type (string/enum [breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks])

### MealEntries
- id (UUID, PK)
- meal_id (FK references Meals.id)
- food_name (string)
- serving_size (numeric/string)
- servings (numeric)
- protein (float)
- carbs (float)
- fat (float)
- calories (float)
